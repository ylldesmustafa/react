# Exercise 2 - News Site

For this exercise, you will be leveraging a Public News API to create a basic News Site.

Go to https://public-apis.io/category/news-apis, and select a News API of your choice to pull data from.  Note that you may need to spend some time reading the documentation (docs) of the API to understand how to use it.  

You are required to create a Single Page Application (SPA) using React.js and React-Router. 

**Requirements**

- Must implement Client Side Routing using React Router
- Must have at least 3 linkable "Views" related to a News Site.  Sports, Weather, & Politics are provided, but feel free to add more at your discretion.  
- Each View should display only the news related to that View.  (You should not be able to see Sports news on the Weather View for example.)
- The Headline News View should be rendered on the Main page.  
- User Interface (UI) should be fully styled and presentable.  

**Optional**
- Each News Article summary / thumbnail must be clickable and route to another News Detail View that displays the entire article.
- Style the App using SCSS
